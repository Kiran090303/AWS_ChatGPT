## 📐 Setup Amazon Bedrock

AWS Bedrock provides easy access to advanced generative AI models through a unified API. By following a simple setup process, you can deploy private instances of these models to enhance your projects.

### Key Steps:

1. **Sign Up for an AWS Account**

   Before getting started, ensure you have an AWS account with programmatic access enabled. If you don't already have an account, visit [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) to create a free account.

2. **Request Access to Models in the AWS Bedrock Console**

   Once signed in, use the search bar to navigate to the Bedrock console. Click on “Request model access” and submit your use case for the models you wish to use. Note that certain models may be available only in specific regions like US East and US West.

3. **Get Approved Instantly**

   After submitting your request, AWS typically grants access immediately. You'll receive an email notification from AWS once access is granted.
